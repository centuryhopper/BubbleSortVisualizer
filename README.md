# This is a project showcasing the five most commonly discussed sorting algorithms, namely bubble, insertion, selection, merge, and quick.
### The entire project is written in the C programming language using raylib and raygui libraries and the results are compiled to assembly so that I may deploy them for anyone to play around with app. I encourage you to try it out and I look forward to hearing your feedback!
